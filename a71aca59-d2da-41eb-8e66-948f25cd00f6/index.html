<p>Trees grow however makes them happy. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Anyone can paint.

Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. And just raise cain.

If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Just use the old one inch brush. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will.

Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.

Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.

I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.
